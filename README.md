Hello, my name is Hanna Traphagan. 

I am a junior software engineer with a passion for creative problem solving and collaborative, efficient design.

With a master's degree in public health and over 5 years of experience in education, research, and program management, I am excited to pivot my career into development. In January of 2022 I began teaching myself some basics, and that following May, I enrolled in a self-paced software engineering course with Springboard. As someone who is infinitely passionate about learning, I have found this journey to be both fulfilling and challenging... which is a welcome change of pace for me! 

I am currently looking for a job as a software engineer, and I am excited to join a team where I can learn, grow, and contribute to some interesting projects. Most of all, I am thrilled to continue improving my skills and seeing where this new career path will lead.

Thanks for stopping by!
